## General Information
- We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and
- decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.


## Conclusions
- Ridge and Lasso ALPHA vlaues are 2 and 0.00011
- there are around 85 variables that impact the model out of more than 200 columns
- the ones with + ve and -ve coefficients are mentioned below
